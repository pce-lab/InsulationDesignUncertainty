# PDE-constrained optimization for insulation components of buildings uncder high-dimensional uncertainty
> This repository contains a predictive model of PDE-constrained optimization with application to a L-shaped insulation component. There are two methods used for predicting the optimal design under uncertainty: multi-objective optimization and optimization with chance constraints.
